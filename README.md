# Foodie Movies Bucket List
A website for generating ideas for movies and food based off of an ingredient.

## Project Description
![Website Screenshot](INSERT SCREENCAP OF FINISHED PROJECT HERE "Website Screenshot")

For Module 9's Challenge, we were challenged to make a website from scratch utilising JavaScript, two server-side APIs, Bootstrap and client-side storage whilst together working in a group.

Our idea was to create a website for a date or movie night that would help provide inspiration on what the user could watch and cook for the evening.

The website we made will create a list of films and recipes based off on an ingredient that the user inputs using the search feature. A grid of movies will then generate upon hitting search, along with a list of recipes underneath.

## Our Approach

We started off by creating a Google Doc stating all of the requirements for the project, along with our general ideas. Once we had decided what we wanted to make, we split the work amongst the 3 of us with Ewa on the Movies API, Farha on the Recipes API and building the websites skeleton and Max on the front-end visuals of the site. We then created a mock-up of how we'd like the website to look using Penpot. 

## Technologies

This website was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 4, the Spoonacular API and the OMDb API.
